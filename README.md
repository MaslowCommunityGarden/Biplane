# Biplane

Child's ride on Biplane


The original plan (magazine article) was modified from a rocking design to turn this into a riding toy. 

This set of plans has not yet been built so some modification may be needed. 

The original build of this plane (photo shown) was done completely by hand and has features (Spinning propeller) that this model does not have.

I have included my g code file (based on using 0.25" cutters) â€“ I recommend you review this file before using. I have run this program and it did not have any issues (cut time ~ 1hr 45 minute cut time). 

Active "Z" axis control is required.
